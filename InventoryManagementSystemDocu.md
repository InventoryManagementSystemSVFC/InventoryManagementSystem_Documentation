### A. INTRODUCTION

Manually managing inventory is prone to human error, such as miscounts or misplaced records, leading to inaccuracies that can disrupt operations. The Inventory Management System is a critical tool used by businesses of all sizes to manage and control their inventory levels, orders, sales, and deliveries. The primary purpose of an Inventory Management System is to ensure that a business has the right amount of stock at the right time to meet customer demand without overstocking or under stocking. In today’s fast-paced and competitive business environment, an effective Inventory Management System is essential for managing resources efficiently and achieving long-term business success. With real-time data and analytics, owners and managers can make informed decisions about purchasing, sales strategies, and inventory management, leading to better overall business performance. 

An inventory management system's overall goal is to make inventory management more effective, economical, and customer-focused, which will increase a company's profitability and competitiveness. The system standardizes and simplifies inventory management processes, making it easier for staff to perform their duties with fewer errors and less confusion. Sales and customer service teams can quickly check inventory levels and provide accurate information to customers, ensuring that orders are fulfilled promptly and correctly. With comprehensive reports and analytics, businesses can identify patterns, forecast demand, and plan for seasonal fluctuations or market changes.
